Amazon CloudFront works seamlessly with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to accelerate the delivery of your web content and reduce the load on your origin servers.

 The  steps are:
1. Go to the AWS Console
2. Create an Amazon S3 bucket
3. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution
4. Specify your distribution settings
5. Configure your origin
6. Configure Origin Access Identity
7. Configure default cache behavior
8. Configure your TTLs
9. Configure additional features
10. Test your CloudFront distribution
Additionally, we created an Amazon CloudFormation Template to help you get started. This template will launch a S3 bucket to store your static files at scale then
 deliver that content to your users over the CloudFront Content Delivery Network (CDN). The CloudFront edge locations will cache and deliver your content closer to 
your users to reduce latency and offload capacity from your origin. CloudFront will also restrict access to your S3 bucket to only CloudFront endpoints rendering your
 content and application more secure and performant. Lastly, because AWS does not charge for data transfers between an AWS-hosted origin such as Amazon S3 and 
CloudFront, origin fetches are cost-effective.

serve video on demand or live streaming video.
CloudFront offers several options for streaming your media to global viewers both pre recorded files and live events.
For video on demand (VOD) streaming, you can use CloudFront to stream in common formats such as MPEG DASH, Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, and CMAF, to any
 device.
For broadcasting a live stream, you can cache media fragments at the edge, so that multiple requests for the manifest file that delivers the fragments in the right
 order can be combined, to reduce the load on your origin server.
